# CS3460 - Modern C++ Assignments

Welcome to the repository for assignments completed in CS3460 - Modern C++ at Utah State University. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of C++ programming, ranging from algorithm implementation to exploring and improving standard library features. Below is a brief overview of each assignment:

## Assignment 1: N-Bonacchi Sequence Algorithm
- Implementation of the N-Bonacchi sequence algorithm.

## Assignment 2: Random Distribution Algorithm
- Development of a random distribution algorithm.

## Assignment 3: Random Distribution with Header Files
- Migration of the random distribution implementation to header files.
- Separation of implementation in a .cpp file from the header files.

## Assignment 4: Array Performance in C++
- Assessment of different array performance used by the standard library in C++.

## Assignment 5: Predictive Tests with K-Airy Tree Algorithm
- Algorithm for creating predictive tests using a K-Airy tree algorithm.

## Assignment 6: Conway's Game of Life Simulator
- Implementation of Conway's Game of Life simulator in C++.

## Assignment 7: Generic Mass Conversion
- Generic mass conversion utility for various weights.

## Assignment 8: Improved std::vector
- Enhanced std::vector with dynamically sized capacity determined by the programmer, deviating from the default doubling capacity of std::vector.
